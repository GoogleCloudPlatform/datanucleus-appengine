A note about running tests:

You must pass the following flag to the jvm in order for the tests to pass:

-javaagent:lib/datanucleus-enhancer-1.0.1.jar=org.datanucleus.test

This tells Datanucleus to automatically enhance any classes it encounters that live in the
org.datanucleus.test package.  The enhancer ignores classes in org.datanucleus unless
the package is org.datanucleus.test, so you'll be happiest if you just put all the classes
you want enhanced in this package.
